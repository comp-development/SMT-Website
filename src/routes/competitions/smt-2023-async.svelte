            The <strong>Team Round</strong> is a 50-minute exam consisting of 15
            short answer questions.

        <p>
            The <strong>Guts Round</strong> is an 80 minute team exam consisting
            of 9 series of 3 questions each, whereby teams must submit answers to
            a previous round in order to gain access to the next. Subsequent rounds
            are both harder and worth more points than previous rounds.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the individual portion, students may choose to take two subject
            tests in a specific topic or take a single, longer General Test.

        <p>
            The <strong>Subject Tests</strong> are 50-minute exams consisting of
            10 short answer questions. The subjects offered are
            <strong>
                Algebra, Combinatorics, Number Theory, and Geometry.
            </strong>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The <strong>General Test</strong> is a 110-minute exam consisting of
            25 short answer questions that is designed for students that have less
            specialized mathematical background.

        Make sure to check the rules page for detailed information regarding
        SMT. If your question is not answered below, feel free to contact the
        SMT coordinators at <a href="mailto:stanford.math.tournament@gmail.com"

        <strong>Registration</strong><br />
        Q: How many students may be on a team?<br />
        A: Teams consist of 5-6 members. Individuals and incomplete teams may be combined by organizers to form complete teams.<br />
        <br />
        Q: Do students on the same team have to be from the same school or established mathematical organization?<br />
        A: Yes, students must be from the same school or mathematical organization<br />
        <br />
        Q: What schools or organizations can participate in SMT Asyncronous?<br />
        A: SMT 2023 Asyncronous will be open to all students.<br />
        <br />
        <br />
        
        <strong>Testing</strong><br />
        Q: Are calculators allowed?<br />
        A: No. Calculators are not allowed on any portion of the tests. Check the
        SMT rules for information on permitted items.<br />
        <br />
        Q: What topics may appear on the tests? How hard are the tests?<br />
        A: See the mathematical expectations document for guidelines on what topics
        may appear on each test. It is also advisable to look at the test from previous
        years in order to get a sense of the typical style and difficulty of SMT
        tests.<br />
        <br />
        <!--
        Q: Which individual test should I take?<br />
        A: If you have little or no experience with contest math, we strongly recommend
        you take the General Test. Looking at past tests will help you get a sense
        of the difficulty of each test.<br />
